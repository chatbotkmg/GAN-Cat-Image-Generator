# GAN-Cat-Image-Generator

This repository contains code for training a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate images of cats. The project aims to demonstrate the process of creating a GAN model and training it to generate realistic images by learning from real-world data.

## Overview

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Generator**: A neural network that generates images based on random noise. The generator learns to create images similar to real images.
2. **Discriminator**: A neural network that classifies images as real or fake. It tries to distinguish between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (generated by the generator).

Both the generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial process where the generator improves by attempting to fool the discriminator.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to train a GAN to generate images of cats. The generator starts by creating simple images and gradually improves over time. This project serves as a foundation for learning about GANs and their application to image generation.

## Contents

- `version_1_numbergenerator`: Code for generating hand-written numbers (28x28 pixel images) using GAN.
- `version_1`: The code and model architecture for generating images of cats using a GAN.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `torchvision`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `PIL`

You can install these dependencies by running the following:

bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pillow
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/chatbotkmg/GAN-Cat-Image-Generator.git
cd GAN-Cat-Image-Generator
Install the dependencies mentioned above.

To train the model for generating cat images, you can run the training script in version_1/ (if provided).

bash
python train.py
You can also explore the different versions of the code for generating hand-written numbers in version_1_numbergenerator/ folder.

Training Process
Data: The GAN is trained on images of cats from a dataset (which you need to download or provide your own dataset).

Generator: Starts by generating random images. Over time, the generator improves by fooling the discriminator into classifying the fake images as real.

Discriminator: Learns to differentiate between real and fake images, gradually helping the generator improve.

Next Steps
Improvements: In the future, the model can be improved by using more complex architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both the generator and discriminator.

Higher Resolution: Explore generating higher resolution images and experimenting with larger datasets.

Fine-tuning: Experiment with different loss functions and optimizers to achieve better training stability.
