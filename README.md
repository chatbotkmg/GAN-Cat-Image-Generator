# GAN-Cat-Image-Generator

This repository contains code for training a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate images of cats. The project aims to demonstrate the process of creating a GAN model and training it to generate realistic images by learning from real-world data.

## Overview

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Generator**: A neural network that generates images based on random noise. The generator learns to create images similar to real images.
2. **Discriminator**: A neural network that classifies images as real or fake. It tries to distinguish between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (generated by the generator).

Both the generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial process where the generator improves by attempting to fool the discriminator.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to train a GAN to generate images of cats. The generator starts by creating simple images and gradually improves over time. This project serves as a foundation for learning about GANs and their application to image generation.

## Contents

- `version_1_numbergenerator`: Code for generating hand-written numbers (28x28 pixel images) using GAN.
- `version_1`: The code and model architecture for generating images of cats using a GAN.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `torchvision`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `PIL`

You can install these dependencies by running the following:

bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pillow
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/chatbotkmg/GAN-Cat-Image-Generator.git
cd GAN-Cat-Image-Generator
Install the dependencies mentioned above.

To train the model for generating cat images, you can run the training script in version_1/ (if provided).

bash
python train.py
You can also explore the different versions of the code for generating hand-written numbers in version_1_numbergenerator/ folder.

Training Process
Data: The GAN is trained on images of cats from a dataset (which you need to download or provide your own dataset).

Generator: Starts by generating random images. Over time, the generator improves by fooling the discriminator into classifying the fake images as real.

Discriminator: Learns to differentiate between real and fake images, gradually helping the generator improve.

Next Steps
Improvements: In the future, the model can be improved by using more complex architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both the generator and discriminator.

Higher Resolution: Explore generating higher resolution images and experimenting with larger datasets.

Fine-tuning: Experiment with different loss functions and optimizers to achieve better training stability.

# Hand-Written Number Generator using GAN

This version of the project uses a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate hand-written numbers. The generator learns to create images of numbers similar to those in the MNIST dataset, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Overview

- **Generator**: Takes random noise as input and generates images of hand-written numbers (28x28 pixels).
- **Discriminator**: Takes an image as input and classifies it as either real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the GAN).
  
Both networks are trained together, and the generator improves by attempting to fool the discriminator.

## Purpose

The goal of this version is to showcase the basic working of a GAN applied to a well-known problem: generating hand-written numbers. It serves as a foundation to build more advanced models and explore more complex datasets, such as generating images of animals, faces, or even more complex scenes.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to the version_1 directory:

bash

cd version_1
Install dependencies (if not installed):

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

bash

python hand_written_number_generator.py
Current Issues and Next Steps
The current generator struggles to generate high-quality images and needs further improvements, such as increasing the network complexity (e.g., using Convolutional Neural Networks).

The current model uses a basic feedforward architecture which can be enhanced with more advanced techniques like DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN).

The next steps involve training the model on a more complex dataset and improving the generator's ability to generate realistic images.
