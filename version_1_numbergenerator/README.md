# Hand-Written Number Generator using GAN

This version of the project uses a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate hand-written numbers. The generator learns to create images of numbers similar to those in the MNIST dataset, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Overview

- **Generator**: Takes random noise as input and generates images of hand-written numbers (28x28 pixels).
- **Discriminator**: Takes an image as input and classifies it as either real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the GAN).
  
Both networks are trained together, and the generator improves by attempting to fool the discriminator.

## Purpose

The goal of this version is to showcase the basic working of a GAN applied to a well-known problem: generating hand-written numbers. It serves as a foundation to build more advanced models and explore more complex datasets, such as generating images of animals, faces, or even more complex scenes.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to the version_1 directory:

bash

cd version_1
Install dependencies (if not installed):

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

bash

python hand_written_number_generator.py
Current Issues and Next Steps
The current generator struggles to generate high-quality images and needs further improvements, such as increasing the network complexity (e.g., using Convolutional Neural Networks).

The current model uses a basic feedforward architecture which can be enhanced with more advanced techniques like DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN).

The next steps involve training the model on a more complex dataset and improving the generator's ability to generate realistic images.
